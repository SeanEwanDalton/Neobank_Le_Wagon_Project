# Neobank_Le_Wagon_Project
Le Wagon Data Analytics Project

As part of the final assessment in the Le Wagon's data analytics bootcamp, students were split into groups of 4 and given a data analytics task to complete.

We received 4 data sources from Neobank (a fictional bank) and were then issued a very tasks to solve based on the data analysis.

Together we cleaned the data, transformed it into enriched data to be manipulated in Google Big Query, visualised the data in Google Looker, completed A/B testing and time series analysis in Google Colaborate and then created a presentation in Canva. We then presented our findings to our fellow students and lecturers. 

This project brought together all the skills we had learned throughout the bootcamp and focused on collaborative teamwork in order to achieve our goal and complete the tasks.
